            <h3 style="padding-top: 5%;">Barefoot Back Walk</h3>
            <p>Foot" (ashi) "pressure" (atsu), Ashiatsu recipients are simply calling this technique "heaven."
                And although Ashiatsu sessions may appear unconventional, with practitioners often holding on to
                specially-attached ceiling bars to maintain their balance while walking on a client's back, this
                type of bodywork is being heralded as a luxurious, deep-tissue massage.<br>
                Beginning in the East, Ashiatsu's history spans several continents and more than 3,000 years.
                Many different styles of barefoot massage have originated from India, Japan, Thailand, China,
                and the Philippines; some are practiced on a floor mat, others require balancing props, such
                as ceiling bars, chairs, bamboo rods, poles, and even ropes and chains.<br>
                When Ashiatsu was first started, its followers were more interested in "chi," or energy, than
                soothing aching muscles. "Asian bodywork is based on Chinese medicine and an energy body map,"
                explains Barbra Esher, director of education for the American Organization for Bodywork Therapies
                of Asia (AOBTA) and a certified Ashiatsu instructor. "We get a lot of education in Western anatomy
                and physiology, but our main concern is treating the energetic body. And because of that, a huge
                amount of our education is in those theories -- like yin and yang.<br>

            <h3>Thai Massage</h3>
            <p>What is Thai Massage?<br>
                Thai massage is believed to have been developed by Jivaka Kumar Bhaccha, physician to Buddha,
                more than 2,500 years ago in India. It made its way to Thailand, where the Ayurvedic techniques and
                principles gradually became influenced by traditional Chinese medicine. For centuries, Thai massage
                was performed by monks as one component of Thai medicine.<br>
                What Does Thai Massage Feel Like?<br>
                Thai massage is more energizing and rigorous than more classic forms of massage.<br>
                Thai massage is also called Thai yoga massage, because the therapist uses his or her hands, knees,
                legs, and feet to move you into a series of yoga-like stretches. Many people say Thai massage is
                like doing yoga without any work.<br>
                Muscle compression, joint mobilization, and acupressure are also used during treatment.<br>
