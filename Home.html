                    <div class="card card-body">
                        Summer was born in Nanning Guangxi China. She was raised in a small country town where she learned the value
                        of a hard day’s work raising food in the fields, on the community farm, for her family and
                        fellow town members.<br>
                        Later in life she decided to move to the big city of Nanning (6 million people) and build a new career in
                        the cosmetology industry. There she learned to be a very skilled hair stylist and received training and
                        experience in the art of Chinese massage and barefoot massage therapy. After her training was complete, and
                        with some experience under her belt, she under took the great task of becoming the owner of her own hair
                        and massage spa.<br>
                        She built her business to be very strong for ten years before making the difficult decision to leave her
                        country, family and friends to move to America and start her own family. Together they have three boy and
                        they are all living together in Urbandale Iowa.<br>
                        After a few years of taking care of her children at home, she realized it was time to get back to her
                        career. She felt very strongly that she would prefer to advance her training and skills in the massage
                        therapy field, rather than furthering herself as a hair stylist. Her decision was based on her desire to
                        help those people in need of relief from their pain, and the content she feels when her client’s needs have
                        been fulfilled. After some deep research on massage therapy schools, it was quite clear that "Body Wisdom
                        Massage Therapy School" was the place where she would receive the best, most intense training for her
                        career.<br>
                        Summer began her United States massage training in 2010 at Body Wisdom Massage Therapy School. There she
                        received exceptional training in many different modalities of massage therapy: Deep Tissue, Swedish
                        Relaxation Massage,Ashiatsu (Barefoot Back Walk), Jin Shin Do Chinese trigger points, myofacial, positional
                        release, just to name a few. But her passion, and her greatest skill, is her ability to identify problem
                        areas for her clients and relive their pain with her truly skilled hands and her incredible natural
                        abilities in the art of massage therapy.<br>
                        During her deep tissue training, and along with many, many hours of examining her anatomy teachings, she
                        came to realize her natural ability to find and relieve the symptoms of her client’s problematic areas.
                        This ability has given her the strength and desire to learn all that is possible to learn about sport and
                        injury massage therapy in the hopes that she can be renowned as the best therapist available for her
                        clients in need.<br>

                    A relaxing Swedish massage is often a baseline for clients. In a general Swedish massage,
                    your session may start with broad, flowing strokes that will help calm your nervous system and
                    relax exterior muscle tension.<br>
                    As your body becomes relaxed, pressure will gradually be increased to relax specific areas and
                    relieve areas of muscular tension.<br>
                    Often, a light oil or lotion is used to allow your muscles to be massaged without causing excessive
                    friction to the skin. The oil also helps hydrate your skin. <br>
                    You should communicate immediately if you feel any discomfort so that another approach may be taken.
                    <br>
                    Massage and bodywork are most effective when your body is not resisting.

                    Prior to the massage, feel free to ask the practitioner any questions about the technique or the
                    upcoming session. During the massage, make yourself comfortable. <br>
                    The practitioner will either gently move you or tell you what is needed throughout the session

                    Most people feel very relaxed. Some experience freedom from long-term aches and pains developed
                    from tension or repetitive activity. <br>
                    After an initial period of feeling slowed down, people often experience increased energy, heightened
                    awareness, and greater productivity which can last for days. <br>
                    Since toxins are released from your soft tissues during a massage, it is recommended you drink

                    Yes. That's why it's imperative that, before you begin your session, the practitioner asks general
                    health questions. <br>
                    It is very important that you inform the practitioner of any health problems or medications you are
                    taking. <br>
                    If you are under a doctor's care, it is strongly advised that you receive a written recommendation
                    for massage or bodywork prior to any session. <br>
                    Depending on the condition, approval from your doctor may be required.
